🪄 Overview

Book Finder is a beginner-friendly React web app that allows users to search for books using the Open Library API.
When you type a book title (like Harry Potter or Pride and Prejudice), it fetches real-time results and displays the cover image, author, and first publish year.

This project helped me understand how to use React hooks, APIs, and styling in a real-world application.
